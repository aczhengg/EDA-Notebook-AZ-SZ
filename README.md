## Project Description
This project is based on significant and current health trends witnessed across the United States. With number of caregivers declining, life expectancy for older generations increasing, and prevalence of chronic diseases exacerbating, it's imperative to understand and analyze the various factors influencing US nursing home care quality. Nursing homes have long been a fundamental part of the US's healthcare landscape, in both preventive and diagnostic care. Given their importance, this study aims to identify key factors that influence resident and resident family's perceptions on nursing home care by analyzing demographics such as sex, race, income, and payment source. We placed an emphasis on analyzing payment source and income levels because of the known discrepancies between federally funded nursing homes and privately funded. Federally funded nursing homes tend to see more frequent management changes, lower quantity of qualified nurses and staff, and potentially different patterns in care quality compared to non-federally funded nursing homes. Individuals paying through private long term insurance are more likely to obtain better care quality by affording better facilities, a difference that may contribute to divergent perceptions among residents and their family. 

The data utilized in this study originated from a nationally administered Internet-based survey to individuals with nursing home experience within the last 6 months in 2017 and 2019. Participants were recruited from the Survey Sampling International (SSI) US online panel, a global research company that represents over 3.7 million households worldwide and holds access to online survey panels. Participants between the 2017 and 2019 cohorts are exclusive, so there is no participant in both cohorts. Each participant is asked to rank factors of care from 0 (extremely poor) to 10 (extremely high). This approach facilitated a quantitative evaluation of these factors so participant perspectives can be analyzed systematically and significant factors can be pinpointed as exerting the most substantial influence on resident satisfaction.
